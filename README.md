# SQL Data Warehouse Project

This project demonstrates how to build a **modern data warehouse** using **SQL Server**. It covers the full data engineering lifecycle including **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes, **data modeling**, and **analytical querying**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to design and implement a scalable SQL Server-based data warehouse that supports business intelligence tasks such as reporting, trend analysis, and decision-making.

### Key Components:
- **ETL Processes**: Extracting data from source systems, transforming it to meet business requirements, and loading it into the warehouse.
- **Data Modeling**: Applying best practices (star/snowflake schemas) to structure data for performance and clarity.
- **Analytics**: Writing efficient SQL queries to derive insights and generate business reports.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- SQL Server Express / Standard / Developer
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- T-SQL (Transact-SQL)
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) *(optional if used)*
